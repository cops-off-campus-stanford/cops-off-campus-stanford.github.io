  "<p> The SUDPS isn’t fully private, like Stanford originally wanted it to be, and isn’t fully public. It exists in a hybrid position where they’re partially governed by Stanford, and partially governed by the Santa Clara County Sheriff in accordance with a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Stanford and Santa Clara County. Stanford created a problematic, destructive, and strange agreement with the County, which is what allowed campus security to be deputized to positions where they have about the same training as police officers, and the same enforcement power. The SUDPS has existed in this state since the 1970s, which we will trace the history of now. </p>";

"<p> In February 2021, Stanford completed the construction of a new $33.5 million Public Safety Building, which had been in the University’s capital plan for over a decade. The building is intended to consolidate Stanford University Department of Public Safety (SUDPS) personnel and functions into a single location on East Campus. The building’s construction has been marked by delays and budgetary expansions, concerns over increased policing and punishment, and uncertainty regarding the building’s functions. </br></br> The Public Safety Building has appeared as a forecasted construction project on the University budget since the 2005-2006 fiscal year. At the time, the project was expected to be completed in 2008 with a cost of $4.4 million. However, year after year, the project was further delayed and the projected cost was increased. By the 2016-2017 fiscal year, the project was expected to be completed in 2019 and the expected cost had risen to $16.6 million. Yet one year later, the expected timeframe remained the same though the expected cost jumped to $31.5 million. The final cost and completion time were a significant departure from initial expectations, and the community was given little transparency regarding the source of the delays and price increases. </br></br> Once construction actually began, members of the community started raising concerns about the purpose of the building given its ties to policing, which many feel undermines public safety. Others expressed concerns about the timing of construction given the budgetary constraints during the COVID-19 pandemic, which the University previously cited as a major force in its decision to stop paying contracted service workers. Finally, the community has been left in the dark regarding the building’s internal functions - SUDPS has avoided releasing a statement about the purpose of the building. Despite the lack of transparency, a project overview from the building’s construction firm states that the building will incorporate “prisoner processing, equipment/evidence storage, women’s locker and shower rooms, spill-over administrative spaces and telephone equipment rooms,” suggesting that the building will be used directly by SUDPS for policing.</p>";

  "<p>On March 20, 2002 (during finals week of winter quarter), Pedro Calderon, a 20-year-old resident of East Palo Alto, was shot and killed by police at the base of the Stanford foothills. Calderon, who was a Hispanic man, was initially flagged by a SUDPS community service officer who thought he resembled a suspect in a series of car burglaries on campus. While Calderon attempted to flee the confrontation that ensued, Stanford Police Deputy Jeff Bell and Palo Alto Police Officer Jessica Perryman each fired one shot. Calderon and Perryman were taken to Stanford Hospital; Perryman was treated for cuts and abrasions to her legs, and Calderon was pronounced dead.</p>";
